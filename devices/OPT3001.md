The [OPT3001](http://www.ti.com/product/OPT3001) is a sensor that measures the
intensity of visible light. The spectral	response of the sensor tightly matches
the photopic response of the human eye and includes	significant infrared rejection.

You can use the [[OPT3001.js]] module with the OPT3001 as follows:

I2C
---

```
var i2c = new I2C();
i2c.setup({sda:..., scl:...});

var o = require("OPT3001").connectI2C(i2c);

setTimeout(function() {
  print(o.read())
}, 1000);
```

**Note:** you can supply `addr` to `connectI2C`'s second argument to set an I2C
address if it is non-standard.
