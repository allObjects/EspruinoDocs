XPT2046 / ADS7843 Touchscreen
=================

* KEYWORDS: Module,Touchscreen,SPI,XPT2046,ADS7843,Sensor,Custom,Calibration,Porch,LCD,Dispaly


Overview
------------------
The XPT2046 is pin and function compatible to ADS7843 touch screen controller for resistive touch screens. Therefore, the [[XPT2046.js]] and [[ADS7843.js]] are *basically* interchangeable - *basically* - except when accuracy and simplicity to achieve the accuracy matter.


Rational for XPT2046's and ADS7843's Commons and Differences
------------------

Since the [[XPT2046.js]] module is built based on the [[ADS7843.js]] module, they share the basic structure and principle of operation except in regard to accuracy in mapping touch points to display coordinates.

Accurate mapping - and the ability to fine tune the calibration of the mapping is essential when it comes to UX with GUIs. touchscreens overlay displays and obtain exact display coordinates gets challenging but is crucial for the proper functioning of touch GUIs.

[[XPT2046.js]]'s accuracy and linearity is down (up?) to a couple to a few pixels. Such accuracy is required to deliver expected UX on touch GUIs, especially with displays with small pixels and when using a touch screen stylus (see forum conversation about [Touchscreen](http://forum.espruino.com/conversations/292641/ which compares the numbers of both modules).

How do the modules differ?

First of all, [[XPT2046.js]] can accept a fine tunable / calibrate-able mapping function versus the built-in / hard-coded and limited tunable / calibrate-able mapping function of the [[ADS7843.js]]. [[ADS7843.js]] msppinh function is limited to x and y extension and offsets only. x and y extension and offsets only work well for touch screen and display with exactly matching sizes and position to a pixel... which is practically never the case. Touch screen's active area always overlap the display area in order to cover the whole display area even with limited positioning accuracy in manufacturing.

Furthermore, many screens have an added coverage where general purpose buttons, such as *home, menu, back, etc.*, or buttons to launch specific applications, such as *phone, calendar, calculator, notebook, etc*. These extra 'coverage' / extension is by design, is often called a *porches*, and is not evenly distributed.[[XPT2046.js]] module's mapping function can take care of all these options and can be adjusted at runtime and not only that, but also the ability to switch from portrait to landscape and back and changing direction of the axis at runti9me by just adjusting / replacing the mapping function.

In straight and mathematical defense of the [[ADS7843.js]] module's built-in mapping function has to be said, that with some decent effort, the same final accuracy can be achieved: The connect has to be fed with virtual x and y extension - generally larger than the display - and the obtained x and y values have to be mapped again - scaled and offset (and clipped) - first thing in the callback for consummation by the application. Not a straight forward thing in obvious manner but comfortably feasible based on a dedicated calibration application :) ... ( [[XPT2046.js]] module uses also a calibration application to determine the parameter for the concise mapping function... :/ .)

Furthermore, [[XPT2046.js]] delivers more information to the callback in order provide the application implementation more and more importantly easy and encapsulated access to the controller for the application on-the-go for - last but not least - controller calibration and adjustment options (...in remembrance of the ground-breaking s Palm Pilot and OS from U.S. Robotics / Palm Inc. - now - 20+ years ago...).

Usage
------------------

*Note that the parameters of the mapping function are calibrated for the readily available 2.2" 240x320 262K Color TFT LCD display with resistive touch screen and built in touch screen controller ADS7843 / XPT2046 / ... controller, also documented on Espruino site at [[ILI9341]].*.

Portrait format:

```JavaScript
SPI2.setup({sck:B13, miso:B14, mosi:B15, baud: 2000000});
var touch = require("XPT2046").connect(
  SPI2, B10, B1, function(x, y){
      if (x !== undefined) {
        console.log( x + " @ " + y);
      }
    }, function(yR, xR, d, m) { // portrait 240 x 320
        return [ // rawVal / valPerPx * offset
            Math.round(xR / -121.44  + 259.707) 
          , Math.round(yR /   88.904 + -19.781)
          , d, m
          ];
    }).listen();
```

Swiping diagonally from top/left to bottom/right on a 240 x 320 portrait display 
w/ touch screen creates output like this:

```JavaScript
24 @ 30
45 @ 64
66 @ 108
100 @ 153
139 @ 203
171 @ 262
208 @ 308
```

Landscape format:

```JavaScript
SPI2.setup({sck:B13, miso:B14, mosi:B15, baud: 2000000});
var touch = require("XPT2046").connect(
  SPI2, B10, B1, function(x, y){
      if (x !== undefined) {
        console.log( x + " @ " + y);
      }
      }, function(xR, yR, d, m) { // landscape 320 x 240
          return [ //rawVal / valPerPx + offset
              Math.round(xR /  -88.904 +  339.781)
            , Math.round(yR / -121.44  +  259.707) 
          ];
    }).listen();
```


Usage Explained and Coded within ```onInit()```:
------------------


```JavaScript
var touch, tMod = require("XPT2046");

function onInit() {
  // ...
  // setup touchscreen 
  SPI1.setup({sck:A5, miso:A6, mosi:A7, baud: 2000000});
  touch = tMod.connect( // spi, cs, irq, callback, calc
      SPI1, A3, A2, function(x, y, rd, m) { // portrait input
          if (x !== undefined) { console.log(x + " @ " + y); }
      }, function(yR, xR, d, m) { // calc function (portraying, top/left=0/0)
      // calc function converts raw x / y to x / y screen coordinates;
      // scale and offset values are calculated using markers
      // and default calc function - values below work well for
      // common 2.2" 240x320 pixels 262K Color TFT LCD display w/ touchscreen 
      // see http://forum.espruino.com/conversations/292641 - Touchscreen     
          return [ // next two lines are code templates for calculation
      //      Math.round(xr /   xScale + xOff) // / x scale per pixel + x offset
      //    , Math.round(yr /   yScale + yOff) // / y scale per pixel + y offset
              Math.round(xr / -121.44  + 259.707) 
            , Math.round(yr /   88.904 + -19.781)
            , m // module
            ];
      }, 50).listen(); // scan interval on touch to track moving in milliseconds
  // ...
}
```


API and bits of the implementation
------------------

- `.connect(spi, cs, irq, callback, calc, scan)` to connect XPT2046 / ADS7843 controller, where arguments are:
  - `spi` configured SPI instance used to communicate (MOSI, MISO, SCK)
  - `cs` hardware chip select (usually used when more than one device connect to the same SPI instance)
  - `irg` interrupt request from controller which indicates touch (change) event
  - `callback(x,y,touch)` callback called on touch (change) event and in `scan` interval while touching and moving
  - `calc(yR, xR, d, m)` pure (context / this free) mapping function calculating the mapping from raw touch values (normalized anlog read of voltage) to display integer display coordinates with arguments:
    - `yR` raw (read) y touch value from [0...1) extracted from d - complete data as delivered by the controller (UInt8Array)
    - `xR` raw (read) x touch value from [0...1) extracted from d - complete data as delivered by the controller (UInt8Array)
    - `d` complete data as delivered by the controller (UInt8Array)     
    - `m` module
  - `scan` scan interval to track moving while touching in [ms]
- `.listen(lstn)` with to set listening (`.lstn`) status to invoke or not-to-invoke calllbak on touch event (touch down or move scan) with or without argument:
    - `lstn` absent(undefined) and truey are interpreted as true, any thing else is interpreted as false for setting the listening status
- `.scan` (50, default) scan interval in milliseconds [ms] to track moving while touching
- `.calc` (pass raw values through, default) touch to coordinate mapping / calculation function. Is expected to be provided on connnect or before listening in order to furnish useful values to the callback (except may be when used in - the beginning of the - calibration process). For details see `calc` argument in `.connect(...` and provided examples with code template. 
- `.lstn` listening status whether to invoke or not-to-invoke the callback on touch events (after `.connect()`, module is actually listening to the touch controller hardware all the time and cycles completely and continuously through all touch events but invokes callback only when listening status is truey). 
- `.d` (null, default) complete data as last delivered by / read from the controller (UInt8Array)
- `.t` (0, default) indicating touch state: 0 = not touching/moving/tracking, 1 = touch down, 2 = tracking/moving while touching

*NoteS:*
- Be aware that the [[XPT2046]] module *IS* the sensor and thus a singleton ...just as [[ADS7843.js]] is - while writing this (2017/01) . To use multiple touch devices with this controller (simultaneously) requires a (deep) copy / spawning from the original - in cache residing instance - before using (the copy) in a connect to avoid 'crosstalking' of the sensors... :).
- `.connect()` - and module - do know nothing (directly) about dimension and / of display hardware. The all-encapsulating and this/context free `.calc` function argument and property is the only - and thus only indirect - knowledge about it.
