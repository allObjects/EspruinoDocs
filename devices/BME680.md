[This module](/modules/BME680.js) reads temperature, humidity, pressure and gas quality from Bosch Sensortec's BME680 sensor.

Wiring
------

To wire for I2C:

| BME680 Pin | Espruino      |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| 1 (GND)  | GND             |
| 2 (CSB)  | 3.3v (forces I2C mode)   |
| 3 (SDI)  | SDA pin (A6 in example)      |
| 4 (SCK)  | SCL pin (A7 in example)      |
| 5 (SDO)  | GND (default address)    |
| 6 (VDDIO) | 3.3v           |
| 7 (GND)   | GND            |
| 8 (VDD)   | 3.3v           |

The BME680 can run off 1.8v to 3.6v so can be connected
directly to 3.3v (however some breakout boards contain a
voltage regulator).

Software
-------

### I2C

We're using software I2C here so you can use any pins, but you could
easily use a hardware I2C device such as `I2C1`.

```
var i2c = new I2C();
i2c.setup({sda:A6,scl:A7});
var bme = require("BME680").connectI2C(i2c);

setInterval(function() {
  var data = bme.get_sensor_data();
  console.log(JSON.stringify(data,null,2));
  bme.perform_measurement();
}, 1000);
```

Prints data of the form:

```
{
  "new": true,             // is this a new measurement?
  "temperature": 20.9,     // degrees C
  "pressure": 990.7,       // hPa
  "humidity": 52.425,      // % rH
  "gas_resistance": 95197  // Ohms
 }
```

The first reading is done automatically, but subsequent readings
must be performed by calling `bme.perform_measurement()`. The result
will then be available 1 second later.

#### Different I2C addresses

The BME680's default address is 0x76 (which you get when SDO is connected to
  GND). If SDO is connected to VDD the address can be forced to 0x77.
  
You can specify this new address with:

```
var bme = require("BME680").connectI2C(i2c, {addr:0x77});
```  

### SPI

For usage with SPI, the BME680 module can be intialised as follows:

```
var spi = new SPI();
spi.setup({miso : ..., mosi : ..., sck: ...});
var bme = require("BME680").connectSPI(spi, cs_pin);

setInterval(function() {
  var data = bme.get_sensor_data();
  console.log(JSON.stringify(data,null,2));
  bme.perform_measurement();
}, 1000);
```

### Low-level

The [`BME680` class](/modules/BME680.js) is also exposed via `require("BME680").BME680` so that
you can initialise it with your own read/write functions if needed.

Buying
-----

BME680 ICs are too small to easily hand-solder, so we'd recommend buying
them on a breakout board:

* [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=BME680)
* [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/bme680)
